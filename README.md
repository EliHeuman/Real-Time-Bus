The Real Time Bus Tracker Exercise concludes the ninth week of the MIT xPRO Full Stack Development with MERN course.

## Description of the Project 
Real Time Bus Tracker enables you to see Boston's bus route number one locations in real-time. The bus route pass by MIT and Harvard universities. The tracker uses MBTA API to retrieve the locations every 15 seconds. Blue buses are driving North to South, and red buses are going from South to North. This project uses mainly HTML.

## How to Run
After cloning this project, you will see it consists of three main files and two images.<br>
index.html, styles.css, mapanimation.js., Images/Blue.png, Images/Red.png<br>
The index.html file imports Goole Maps API sets the DOM with a map.<br>
The mapanimation.js uses MBTA API to get JSON data for the Boston route and adds markers with the red or blue png file depending on the direction of the bus.<br>
The styles.css uses the class .headline and info-container.wow.fadeInDown.bordered to create the information box styling.
